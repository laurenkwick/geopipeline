Description: Builds off of the `rsi` package for accessing and preprocessing
  specific geospatial datasets. Additional functionality includes output
  dependency on area of interest (AOI) format; producing an .fst serialized 
  data frame of values when POINT data is input, and producing GeoTIFF files
  when POLYGON data is input. Additionally, spatial mosaicing is possible when 
  temporal compositing is ignored. Most datasets are acquired and processed
  through STAC APIs using `rsi` package functionality with the exception of GEDI 
  L3 and ISRIC Soil Grids datasets.
